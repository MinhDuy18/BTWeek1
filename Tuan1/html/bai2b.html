    <p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text, which we didn't get to <u>in the HTML text</u> fundamentals article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

        Prerequisites:	<b>Basic HTML familiarity</b>, as covered in Getting started with HTML. HTML text formatting, as covered in HTML text fundamentals.
        Objective:	<u>To learn how to use lesser-known HTML elements to mark up advanced semantic features.</u>
        <b>Description lists</b>
        <u>In HTML text fundamentals</u>, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML, but we didn't mention <b>the third type of list</b> you'll occasionally come across â€”<u> description lists</u>.</p>
